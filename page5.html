		<p>Emerged in US in the 1700’s – Type of dance characterized by using the sound of tap shoes striking the floor as a form of percussion. The shoes sound is made by metal on the heal and toe of the shoe.
You learn how to move your ankle, ball, and heel of your feet separately or together to make the sound of the taps on the bottom of your shoe.
This dance was formed with several ethnic roots, including, Irish, English, and African.
There is Broadway Jazz and Rhythm Jazz. 
Danced to irregular beats or harmonies of songs and at times no music-the dancer is the musician and the feet are the instruments! 
The lower body is doing a majority of the work, but arms can be added for style. </p>

		<p2> 4 major types of tap dance are Funk Tap, Braodway, Rhythm Tap, and Classical Tap. Tap is one of the few types of dances that require minimum technique from ballet or other types of dance. Using your arms is benefical to give your dance life and character, which learning other genres of dance like jazz would benefit when it comes to arm placement. Ballet would benefit in the sense it helps strengthen your ankles and legs for tap, which takes stamina.</p2>
